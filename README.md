# Game-List

This is a Game-List project that aims to create a game library app which stores all your favorite games.

No more excel sheets! Add, rename and delete custom libraries. Store, edit and delete games inside them. Set different game statuses - track completed games, ones you're currently playing and the ones in your backlog. Mark them as a 'Must Play!' and rate them once you're done.

This was done as a twist on the ToDo List project as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
